let date=new Date();
console.log(date.getTime()); // It gives me the time in milliseconds since the year 1970 bcz it was decided upon this time as a standard time bcz we had to start from somewhere 
console.log(date.getDate());
console.log(date.getMonth()+1); //it follows zero based index just like arrays therefore we added one in it to make it first month of the year that is the month when I was writing this code 
console.log(date.getFullYear());
